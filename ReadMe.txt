FP_ModelS_1b – Example 1 in paper, uses FloPy_T1b as ground truth
FP_ModelS_2 – same code as FP_ModelS_1b, but with a second well. Example 2 in paper, uses FloPy_T3 as ground truth
FP_ModelS_3 – based on FP_ModelS_2, but added two closed boundaries. Also testing for a third closed boundary, increased eff-k and evapotranspiration. Example 3 in paper, uses FloPy_T4 as ground truth.
